Module Name      : sitelang
Version Number   : 0.3 (Beta)
Module developer : Rowd ( http://keybased.net/dev/ )


Module Description

The Site Language module makes the XOOPS core language selectable by the user. Global settings for the chosen language are used, including the correct character set. Unique language specific names can also be given for each installed language, module and block.

The site language can either be selected by a dropdown select form in a block, or by adding ?lg=languageDirectoryName to the url.

IMPORTANT!!
Please read the install_en.txt file for detailed install instructions. This module requires changes to two XOOPS core files to be able to work, which are explained in the install instructions.
